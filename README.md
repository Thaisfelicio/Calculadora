## 📝 Notes

### Hooks
- Hooks can only be created as functions; if you create them as classes, it will not work.
- React has its own built-in hooks, the main ones being: useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.
- By convention, hooks should always start with the prefix "use".
- Hooks must be called at the top level of a component.
- Hooks cannot be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
